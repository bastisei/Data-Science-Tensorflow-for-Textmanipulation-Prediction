# Project Background Explanation
This project aims to replicate the "Add a column from examples" feature found in Power BI Desktop. In Power BI, this feature allows users to add a new column by specifying examples of the desired transformation, making data processing intuitive and straightforward. However, the code provided here focuses primarily on recognizing text transformation patterns rather than directly performing the transformations.

# Project Objectives
-Pattern Recognition: The code identifies transformation patterns based on examples provided by the user.
-Custom Implementation: Users can implement their transformations and share their modifications.

# Features
This project includes several text transformation patterns that users can recognize and implement:
Combine: Combines literal strings or entire column values.
Replace: Replaces a specific substring with another string.
Length: Computes the length of a string.
Extract: Extracts a substring starting from a specific position with a defined length.
First Characters: Extracts the first n characters of a string.
Last Characters: Extracts the last n characters of a string.
Range: Extracts a range of characters within specified start and end indices.
Text before Delimiter: Extracts the text before a specified delimiter.
Text after Delimiter: Extracts the text after a specified delimiter.
Text between Delimiters: Extracts text between two delimiters.
Remove Characters: Removes specific characters from a string.
Keep Characters: Retains only specified characters in a string.

# Invitation to Collaborate
All readers are encouraged to experiment with this pattern recognition feature and expand on it to implement the actual transformations. Feel free to share the resulting code with the community and contribute to this open-source project.
